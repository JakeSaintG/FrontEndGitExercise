# Front End Web Development Git Exercise
## For use in Code Louisville's Front End Web course.. 
You are a developer that has been tasked with adding themselves to the list of class members! You will be going through the entire "feature addition" process from start to finish. Please take this seriously!

## Start Instructions
- Fork repository. This can be done by clicking "Fork" in the upper right hand corner.
- Clone your forked repository to your machine by clicking the "Code" button and copying the url.
    - Can be done either with git terminal (preferred) or by downloading the zip file.
    - Do not use the below command verbatim! Yours will look different.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/{YOUR USERNAME}/FrontEndGitExercise.git
``` 
- Change directory into the folder and create a new branch.
```sh
git branch <branch-name>
```
- You will be adding your name to an HTML document so branch names like the ones below are appropriate.
    - "added-div-containing-my-details"
    - "added-jake-st.germain-to-main-page"
- Checkout, or go to, your new feature branch.
```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```
- Open the file in your preferred IDE, follow the instructions listed in index.html, and come back here to the __Finish Instructions__ section.

## Finish Instructions
- Nice work! Now don't forget to stage your changes and commit them to your branch. Make sure that your commit message is meaningful.
```sh
git add index.html
```
```sh
git commit -m "added-div"
```
- Now push those changes up to your forked repository on Github!
```sh
git push origin <branch-name>
```
- When you go to your forked repo on github.com, you should see a button that says "Compare & Pull Request". If not, refresh or go to the "Pull Requests" tab. Click on it when you find it.
    - A pull request is how most developers add their changes to the main branch of a repository. Code deployments tend to be made from "main" so this is important. They are typically done this way to allow other members of your team to check your code and approve the requests. I will be checking your additions and approving these requests if they are successful!
- Now add a title and message. Sometimes this is auto-filled from your branch name and commit messages. 
- Create the pull request! Nice! I'll get back to you when I see it.
